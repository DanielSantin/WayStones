# WayStones
A plugin that adds waystones to your server, allowing players to teleport between them.

This plugin is designed for survival servers, adding WayStones that are well-balanced for the gameplay, requiring many expensive resources to build and initialise.

The WayStone creates particle effects and low frequency portal sounds effect when players are nearby.

## How To Build

1. Start by creating a 3 by 3 base made out of crying obsidian.
